              Many teams follow a linear design process with a big
              reveal—ta-da!—once the aesthetics, layout, and flow are “ready”
              for client feedback.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Weeks later, the front-end developer enters to turn an approved
              design into a responsive site that functions perfectly across
              devices.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Now imagine showing clients your work in Week 1. How would
              everyone respond to unpolished designs?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Find out from Ben Callahan. In this talk, he’ll describe how to:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                Improvise solutions—and make it a habit—right out of the gate
              </li>
              <li>
                Focus on the people involved, rather than the process itself
              </li>
              <li>
                Solve problems in whatever medium you’re most comfortable using
                Make refinements at the very end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Ben learned all of this when he and his company, Sparkbox, stopped
              designing deliverables and, instead, focused on the end-product.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              And after years of trying to discover The Perfect Process that
              optimizes budgets and skills, he’s finally learned a secret: there
              is no such thing.

              Mobile phones are like research platforms in our pockets. With the
              right strategy, we can quickly understand our users’ behavior,
              wherever they are.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              And given the ubiquity of mobile usage — even among hard-to-reach
              populations — we as UX designers are especially poised to make our
              lives easier while designing better products.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>That is, if we actually do the research.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Fortunately, Cyd Harrell knows how to gather data without breaking
              budgets or extending timelines.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>In this talk, you’ll hear how to:</p>
            <br />

            <ul>
              <li>
                Choose the right mobile methods to answer deeper UX questions
              </li>
              <li>
                Set up a diary study, experience sample, and SMS and voice-based
                survey
              </li>

              <li>
                Identify physical space triggers, and use them to gather more
                user data
              </li>

              <li>
                Build research into your process without breaking the bank
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Cyd’s been doing remote research since 2007 while at Bolt |
              Peters. She even developed methods to broadcast remote research
              sessions to observation teams. Today, as the UX lead for Code for
              America, Cyd regularly performs research on mobile phones from
              low-income residents through smartphone-happy elite populations.

              Have you seen style tiles, element collages, or pattern libraries?
              These are just a few examples of how designers are reacting to the
              explosion of devices and interface sizes.

            <br />

              After all, thinking about the parts of a “page”—not just the sum
              of those parts—helps us create smart, scalable, maintainable
              designs for all those newfangled technologies.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this talk, he’ll introduce Atomic Design, a methodology you can
              use to create a design system in your organization. You’ll learn
              how to:
            </p>
            <br />

            <ul>
              <li>Deconstruct your organizations’ interfaces</li>
              <li>Create systems that includes templates, and pages</li>
              <li>Create designs that are future-friendly and extensible</li>
              <li>
                Establish a repeatable workflow tailored to your team and
                product
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Whenever you read TechCrunch or Entertainment Weekly online,
              you’re looking at Brad’s Atomic Design work. He follows the
              methodology so regularly that he created a free tool called
              Pattern Lab that helps you create your own design systems.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              So if words like “future-friendly” and “flexibility” are
              requirements in your work, then don’t miss this talk.

              For years, we treated the web as if it was a fixed canvas. It took
              the iPhone and Ethan Marcotte’s article on Responsive Web Design
              for us to realize how dynamic the UI could be.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              But in addition to keyboards, we now have touch screens, cameras,
              voice control, and sensors as different kinds of inputs. Plus, we
              can’t know which inputs the user prefers to use until after we’ve
              tried designing with—and for—those inputs.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              So how do we design for all of the explosion of these dynamic
              inputs?

              Jason Grigsby has some ideas you’ll want to hear. Find out why:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>There is no connection between form factor and input</li>
              <li>We can’t detect input until someone uses it</li>
              <li>Aiming for “touch” as the input is a good starting point</li>
              <li>
                Designing for user needs and usage works across form factors
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              And you couldn’t be learning from a more passionate, experienced
              teacher.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Jason has a unique background in researching TV interface design
              and working in JavaScript frameworks for responsive apps. As a
              result, he realized there was a fundamental problem in designing
              for a multi-input world—one that he’s at the forefront of talking
              about.

              In 2015, more people worldwide will use a mobile device to access
              the internet than a traditional computer. Today, 33 percent of
              people in the United States only use a mobile device to browse

              By now, companies know they need to be “on mobile.” But should

            <br />
            <p>
              The answer rarely is such a simple choice. And if you’ve ever
              entered into mobile discussions with a series of stakeholders, it
              may seem impossible to reach consensus.

              What’s going to make your whole company focus on mobile? How do
              people interact with their mobiles device? How can you design for
              this new reality and even create experiences that translate from
              mobile to laptop to TV?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Find out from Luke Wroblewski. He’s got the facts, tips, and case
              studies to help you talk confidently with your team about
              designing intuitive, cross-device experiences. You’ll think about
              how people are using your designs on mobile, whether browsing a
              content-heavy site or interacting with an e-commerce application.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Luke’s talks are chock full of the tools and talking points to
              help design teams make great mobile UX decisions. In fact, you’ll
              see examples from his new product,
              <a href="https://www.polarb.com" target="_blank">Polar</a>, a
              mobile product he created after Twitter acquired his prior
              startup, Bagcheck, just nine months after being launched publicly.

              Why don’t design students coming out of school know about
              responsive design or creating mobile apps? Why are our self-taught
              hackers and C.S. grads having a tough time keeping up with the
              pace of technology innovation?
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              It’s not that schools or professional development programs are
              slow to adapt; it’s more complicated than that. But our tendency
              to focus on skills alone just isn’t sustainable.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Instead, we need to start investing in the ways we create
              designers and fuel their growth.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Doing just that takes a combination of practical education,
              soft-skill development, and a commitment to lifelong learning. And
              in this talk, Jared Spool will dig into all three so you can be a
              part of developing the next generation of designers.
            </p>

            <p>
              This vital topic was the focus of a
              <a href="http://unicorninstitute.com"
                >multi-year research program</a
              >
              Jared conducted with Dr. Leslie Jensen-Inman to identify how orgs
              educate, hire, train, and develop designers. Armed with huge
              amounts of data, the duo then designed and launched Center Centre,
              a bricks-and-mortar school that cultivates industry-ready UX
              designers.

            <p>
              So if you’ve ever wished there was a better system to support
              design thinkers like you, then this is your talk. After all, you
              could be part of defining the ideal solution.
